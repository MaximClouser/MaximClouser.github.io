I am Maxim Clouser, a Machine Learning and Software Engineer with a unique background in hotel administration. My journey began with competitive ice hockey and working in the food and service industry, where I developed a strong interest in coding and data science. This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor’s in Hotel Administration and Computer Science, followed by a Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on deep learning and systems.  

Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have specialized in machine learning, pricing and revenue management, and software development. My internships and coursework have equipped me with the skills to build and maintain software solutions and apply data-driven approaches to solve complex problems.  

I am passionate about leveraging technology to innovate and improve decision-making processes across various industries, particularly in hospitality. My portfolio and CV provide further insights into my work and projects.
